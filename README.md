# random-password-generator

# Objective 

I am creating a password generator for users.

USER will click "Generate Password" button

USER will be prompted with the desired length of password. Length will be ranging from 8 - 128 characters.
IF user input is between 8 - 128, store desired length in VAR password
IF user input isn't between 8 - 128, program will end and user will have to click the "Generate Password" button again

AFTER choosing desired length between 8 - 128
USER will be prompted with the choice of their password to contain uppercase letters (upperChars)
IF yes, user's password will randomly select characters within the choices of uppercase letters (upperChars)
IF no, user's password will not contain any uppercase letters (upperChars)

AFTER user chooses whether or not their password will contain uppercase letters (upperChars)
USER will be prompted with the choice of their password to contain lowercase letters (lowerChars)
IF yes, user's password will randomly select characters within the choices of lowercase letters (lowerChars)
IF no, user's password will not contain any lowercase letters (lowerChars)

AFTER user chooses whether or not their password will contain lowercase letters (lowerChars)
USER will be prompted with the choice of their password to contain special characters (specChars)
IF yes, user's password will randomly select characters within the choices of special characters (specChars)
IF no, user's password will not contain any special characters (specChars)

AFTER user chooses whether or not their password will contain special characters (specChars)
USER will be prompted with the choice of their password to contain numbers (numChars)
IF yes, user's password will randomly select characters within the choices of numbers (numChars)
IF no, user's password will not contain any numbers 

USERS MUST choose at least one password input type
THEN a password from the user desired choices will appear in either a alert or written on the page

## Description

What was your motivation?

My motivation for this project is to create a random password generator for users to get a user-desired password! I also wanted to practice the skills I've learned recently to help them "stick" more. There's no better way to learn than to build stuff! I want to broaden my knowledge on my very beginner skills of JavaScript. This project was to help myself build a strong foundation to build upon as time goes on. I hope you enjoy my project and I will enjoy any feedback you have! 

Why did you build this project? 

I built this project to get more comfortable with if/else statements & for loops. Also, I wanted to help myself understand the logic between it all as well. 
This was a great challenge that had me puzzled for the longest time. This project was also very interesting to me as there were many things to think about. 

What problem does it solve?

This solves a user's problem if they have a hard time brainstorming their own password. They can use this random password generator that is super simple and is all decided on user input! Enjoy!

What did you learn?

I learned the importance of psuedo code. I found how important it is to break down the problem piece by piece until you can't break it down any further no more. This is something I will definitely keep practicing and implement into every coding project, assignment, task & get better with everyday! I learned how to store different array's into a variable based on user input and randomize the array at a user desired length. I learned how vital it is to work with other developers! There are times where you just need another person to talk to & always looks for help. On this project, team work played a big part and communication will something I will be building on as well.
Overall, I learned lots from this project! I hope to learn even more and get better with every project! 

What makes your project stand out?

My project stands out within the simplicity of the code. There is definitely more I can add to the code, but in the time given and with what I've learn so far. I believe my psuedo code compared to my actual code goes hand in hand with one another.
